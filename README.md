# 🌟 Blockchain Gratitude Journal

## Project Overview

Blockchain Gratitude Journal is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to record and share their gratitude entries securely on the blockchain. By leveraging Ethereum smart contracts, this project ensures immutability, transparency, and user-controlled privacy for personal gratitude journaling.

## 🚀 Features

- **Secure Blockchain Storage**: Entries are permanently stored on the Ethereum blockchain
- **Privacy Controls**: Choose between public and private entries
- **Like Functionality**: Engage with and appreciate others' gratitude entries
- **Web3 Integration**: Seamless wallet connection with MetaMask
- **Decentralized**: No central authority controls your gratitude entries

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension
- Ethereum-compatible browser
- Basic understanding of blockchain and Web3

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity ^0.8.0
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Blockchain Interaction**: Web3.js

## 🔧 Installation and Setup

### Smart Contract Deployment

1. Install [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) or [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
2. Compile the smart contract
3. Deploy to your chosen network (Ethereum mainnet, Polygon, or a testnet like Sepolia)

### Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/blockchain-gratitude-journal.git
cd blockchain-gratitude-journal
```

2. Open the `index.html` file in a Web3-compatible browser
3. Ensure MetaMask is installed and connected to the same network as your deployed contract

## 📄 Smart Contract Details

### Key Functions

- `createEntry(string content, bool isPublic)`: Create a new gratitude entry
- `likeEntry(uint256 entryId)`: Like a public entry
- `getUserEntries(address user)`: Retrieve entries for a specific user
- `getPublicEntries()`: Retrieve all public entries

### Entry Structure

```solidity
struct GratitudeEntry {
    address author;
    string content;
    uint256 timestamp;
    bool isPublic;
    uint256 likes;
}
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Entries are immutable once created
- Private entries are only visible to their authors
- Like functionality prevents multiple likes from the same user

## 🌐 Deployment Networks

Recommended networks:
- Ethereum Mainnet
- Polygon
- Sepolia Testnet
- Goerli Testnet

## 💡 Future Roadmap

- [ ] Add commenting feature
- [ ] Implement user profiles
- [ ] Create mobile application
- [ ] Add entry tagging system
- [ ] Develop rewards mechanism for active users
